# SPTempRels
SPTempRels trains and evaluates a structured perceptron model for extracting temporal relations from clinical texts, in which events and temporal expressions are given. It can also be used to replicate the experiments done by [Leeuwenberg and Moens (EACL, 2017)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E/E17/E17-1108.pdf)
